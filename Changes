Revision history for Config-Param

3.000001 (2012-07-20)
	- Whoo! Already an update! Well, it's just a version bump because the first PAUSE upload did not work.

3.000000 (2012-07-20)
	- Finally putting things on CPAN after prettifying the code and API cleanup (including the obligatory OO interface).
	- Some features got added, of course:
		- support for hashes
		- noexit, output, linewidth, silenterr config entries
	- Others got removed:
		- automatic eval() of files
		- ignorehelp config switch (just use nofinals)
	- Behavioural changes:
		- multliline values don't get a line end appended unless there is an empty line before the end marker. Before, it was not possible to enter values that don't end with a line end.
		- --config is an array now, as well as optionally the file config entry
	- Heck, stuff is tested meanwhile!

2.x.y (sometime in 2004, still)

	- Got a lot of use outside the music archive.
	- Published on personal web page.

1.x (sometime in 2004, slightly later)
	- Putting a simple routine to handle command line and configuration file parsing into a module, only working on given 

0.x (sometime in 2004)
	- Starting to write a music archive management system and humbly writing scripts that take command line arguments.
