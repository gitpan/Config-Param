=head1 ABOUT

This archive contains the distribution Config-Param

It contains a comprehensive Module for program configuration from command line or configuration files, including handling of usual boilerplate behaviour like printing help message and exit.

Have a look at the example scripts under examples/ to get started. Tip: start with calling

	examples/simple -h

The script examples/quick_and_dirty is about as minimal as it gets, other variants are more elaborate.

Each script using the module can also generate POD from the parameter specification (and from there, the world is open with possibilities;-).

We don't want to repeat what can be reformatted programmatically, right?

There is one normal executable program, scripts/paramorama, that is installed alongside the module(s). It is a tool to work with the configuration files for other programs and can come in handy indeed. You could consider it a poor-mans text data base, even, as it basically retrieves and stores values from self-describing human-readable text files.

About the overly long module version, conceptually, this is standard dotted-decimal: major.minor.bugfix . It's just filled up to 3 digits for minor and bugfix, then the middle dot removed. It's safer with Perl that way.
